On the latest episode of one of my favourite podcasts [Delete This](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/delete-this/id1356008931?mt=2) Hank and Katherine played a Twitter game where you had to replace all the vowels in a word with 'oob'. I thought this was fun and therefore built this little website. Enjoy!
